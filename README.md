**TERRAFORM**

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool created by HashiCorp. It allows you to define and provision infrastructure across various cloud providers (like AWS, Azure, GCP) using a declarative configuration language (HCL - HashiCorp Configuration Language).

With Terraform, infrastructure is version-controlled, reproducible, and automatable, making it ideal for modern DevOps workflows.

**Key Features:**

Declarative configuration with HCL

Provider-agnostic: supports multi-cloud

Plan & Apply workflow to safely manage changes

State management for tracking deployed infrastructure
